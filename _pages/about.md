I received my M.Sc. and B.Sc. degrees in Mechanical Engineering from the Islamic University of Technology (IUT), where I was awarded the IUT Gold Medal in 2018 for notable academic performance. For my master’s thesis, I characterized the ocean wave energy resources in the exclusive economic zones of the Bay of Bengal, while my bachelor’s thesis focused on modeling a power plant driven by a wave energy converter to meet the electricity demand of Saint Martin’s Island, Bangladesh. Before coming to UT Austin, I served as a lecturer at my alma mater in the Department of Mechanical and Production Engineering from 2019 to 2023. Currently, my research centers on machine learning, with a focus on developing tangent-linear and adjoint models to explore the sensitivities of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) as part of a U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) project. When I’m not immersed in research, you can usually find me swimming or catching a movie at a nearby theater.
